Windows os's developed by Microsoft and used widely in the business and consumeer space, PC usually refers to Windows computer. Mac os will be pre loaded if you buy an apple cpmputer.The last one is Linux operating system, it's an open source operating system, which means its software is free. Share, modify, and distribute is used heavily. Today, Linux has become a huge community effort with developers all over the world contributing to its success. Because Linux is open source, lots of different organizations package their own version of it, we call these different Linux os's distributions. Some common Linux ditributions are open to Ubuntu, Debian and Red hat. Both carlos and Adroid iOS is the Linux kernel underneath hood.\n",

We manage the order program run on our sysytem and how many resources they take up on the run. Process scheduler is part of the kernel that makes this multitasking possible. Next is memory management, optimize usage and make sure our applications have enough memory to run. The last important function is input and output(IO management), this is how our kernel talks to external devices like disc, keyboards, networks,connections, audiodevices and so on.\n",
